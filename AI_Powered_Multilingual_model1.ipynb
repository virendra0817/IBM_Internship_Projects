This project aims to address this need by developing an AI-powered multi-language translator using modern transformer-based neural networks.\n","\n","At the core of the system is Facebook’s M2M100 model — one of the first many-to-many multilingual machine translation models, capable of directly translating between any pair of over 100 languages without needing to pivot through English. Unlike traditional translation systems that require separate models for each language pair, M2M100 handles many-to-many translation efficiently within a single unified model.\n","\n","The translator is integrated with a Gradio-based web interface, which makes the system user-friendly and interactive. Gradio allows users to input text, select source and target languages, and receive real-time translation output — all accessible via a simple web link directly from a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.\n","\n","\n","\n","Key features:\n","✅ Supports multiple languages (English, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and more)\n","✅ Powered by state-of-the-art transformer architecture (M2M100)\n","✅ Fully serverless and runs directly in Google Colab\n","✅ Interactive and shareable web interface built with Gradio\n","✅ No special hardware or deployment server
